This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

What?
    Open source JS lib to build UI
        > Just a lib not a frame work only focus on  `                             only building on RICH UI
    Having RICH ecosystem to use other library like
        > Routing
        > State management
        > so on ..... :)
    To resolve complexity of maintaining advertisements, facebook invent react
    
Why?
    To build a rich front end application we need HTML and CSS but put to-gather to use we need a framework, Angular having lot of components and bundles it's not so simple but react focus only on building UI. By using of component based architecture we can achieve it.      
    
    we can build reusable components and populate corresponding date in components, it will increase the productivity and application performance.
    Eg: Artical component can be used for React angular and vue.
    
    Because of a big organisation and well developed open-source community rest having strong foundation so never let go down, I believe :)
    
    And as I said big community, there is lot of support.
    
    
    REAT IS A DECLARATIVE..?
    
        >Declarative : Just abstraction is enough
        >Imperative : Have to tell algorithmically.
            Eg: Asking a drawing from a artist is differ from a child
            
    React can be partial and full page of application, it will fit into it.
